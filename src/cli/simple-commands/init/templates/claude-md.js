\`\`\`

## Integration Patterns

### Memory-Driven Coordination
Use Memory to coordinate information across multiple SPARC modes and swarm operations:

\`\`\`bash
# Store architecture decisions
./claude-flow memory store "system_architecture" "Microservices with API Gateway pattern"

# All subsequent operations can reference this decision
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement user service based on system_architecture in memory"
./claude-flow sparc run tester "Create integration tests for microservices architecture"
\`\`\`

### Multi-Stage Development
Coordinate complex development through staged execution:

\`\`\`bash
# Stage 1: Research and planning
./claude-flow sparc run researcher "Research authentication best practices"
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication system architecture"

# Stage 2: Implementation
./claude-flow sparc tdd "User registration and login functionality"
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement JWT token management"

# Stage 3: Testing and deployment
./claude-flow sparc run tester "Comprehensive security testing"
./claude-flow swarm "Deploy authentication system" --strategy maintenance --mode centralized
\`\`\`

### Enterprise Integration
For enterprise environments with additional tooling:

\`\`\`bash
# Project management integration
./claude-flow project create "authentication-system"
./claude-flow project switch "authentication-system"

# Security compliance
./claude-flow security scan
./claude-flow security audit

# Analytics and monitoring
./claude-flow analytics dashboard
./claude-flow deploy production --monitor
\`\`\`

## Advanced Batch Tool Patterns

### TodoWrite Coordination
Always use TodoWrite for complex task coordination:

\`\`\`javascript
TodoWrite([
  {
    id: "architecture_design",
    content: "Design system architecture and component interfaces",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high",
    dependencies: [],
    estimatedTime: "60min",
    assignedAgent: "architect"
  },
  {
    id: "frontend_development", 
    content: "Develop React components and user interface",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "medium",
    dependencies: ["architecture_design"],
    estimatedTime: "120min",
    assignedAgent: "frontend_team"
  }
]);
\`\`\`

### Task and Memory Integration
Launch coordinated agents with shared memory:

\`\`\`javascript
// Store architecture in memory
Task("System Architect", "Design architecture and store specs in Memory");

// Other agents use memory for coordination
Task("Frontend Team", "Develop UI using Memory architecture specs");
Task("Backend Team", "Implement APIs according to Memory specifications");
\`\`\`

## Code Style Preferences
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax
- Destructure imports when possible
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use async/await instead of Promise chains
- Prefer const/let over var

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always run typecheck after making code changes
- Run tests before committing changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before merging

## Important Notes
- **Use TodoWrite extensively** for all complex task coordination
- **Leverage Task tool** for parallel agent execution on independent work
- **Store all important information in Memory** for cross-agent coordination
- **Use batch file operations** whenever reading/writing multiple files
- **Check .claude/commands/** for detailed command documentation
- **All swarm operations include automatic batch tool coordination**
- **Monitor progress** with TodoRead during long-running operations
- **Enable parallel execution** with --parallel flags for maximum efficiency

This configuration ensures optimal use of Claude Code's batch tools for swarm orchestration and parallel task execution with full Claude-Flow capabilities.

  --parallel \\
  --monitor \\
  --output json

# The swarm will:
# - Launch multiple WebSearch agents for parallel data gathering
# - Analyze sources with credibility scoring
# - Synthesize findings into comprehensive report
# - Store results in Memory for future reference
\`\`\`

### Development Swarm
\`\`\`bash
# Complex development with hierarchical coordination
./claude-flow swarm "Build microservices authentication system" \\
  --strategy development \\
  --mode hierarchical \\
  --max-agents 8 \\
  --parallel \\
  --monitor

# The swarm will:
# - Architect designs the overall system
# - Team leads coordinate frontend/backend/database teams
# - Parallel implementation with shared Memory
# - Automated testing and integration
\`\`\`

### Analysis Swarm
\`\`\`bash
# Data analysis with mesh coordination
./claude-flow swarm "Analyze application performance metrics" \\
  --strategy analysis \\
  --mode mesh \\
  --parallel \\
  --output sqlite

   - Set appropriate \`--max-agents\` limits
   - Choose right coordination mode

3. **Task Management**
   - Use TodoWrite for all complex projects
   - Set clear priorities and dependencies
   - Update status in real-time
   - Track blockers and issues

4. **Error Handling**
   - Always include error recovery plans
   - Store error patterns in Memory
   - Use security reviews for critical code
   - Test edge cases thoroughly

## Important Notes

- **Always use TodoWrite** for complex task coordination
- **Store critical information in Memory** for persistence
- **Enable parallel execution** when possible for performance
- **Follow SPARC methodology** for systematic development
- **Use swarms** for complex multi-agent objectives
- **Monitor progress** with real-time tracking

- **Test Generation**: 400% faster with parallel test creation
- **Documentation**: 200% improvement with concurrent content generation
- **Memory Operations**: 180% faster with batched read/write operations

## Code Style and Best Practices (Batchtools Enhanced)

### SPARC Development Principles with Batchtools
- **Modular Design**: Keep files under 500 lines, optimize with parallel analysis
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets, validate with concurrent checks
- **Test-First**: Always write tests before implementation using parallel generation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns with concurrent validation
- **Parallel Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation with concurrent updates

### Batchtools Best Practices
- **Parallel Operations**: Use batchtools for independent tasks
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations for efficiency
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and optimize resource usage

## Important Notes (Enhanced)

- Always run tests before committing with parallel execution (\`npm run test --parallel\`)
- Use SPARC memory system with concurrent operations to maintain context across sessions
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle with parallel test generation during TDD phases
- Document architectural decisions with concurrent validation in memory
- Regular security reviews with parallel analysis for authentication or data handling code
- Claude Code slash commands provide quick access to batchtools-optimized SPARC modes
- Monitor system resources during parallel operations for optimal performance

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
