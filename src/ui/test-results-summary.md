### Code Coverage Report

| Module | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **ChatManager.ts** | 93.42% | 68.75% | 100% | 93.42% |
| **Type definitions** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Overall | 26.16% | 18.75% | 18.33% | 26.26% |

**Note**: The overall coverage is low because only ChatManager has been fully tested as a demonstration. The ChatManager itself has excellent coverage (93.42% line coverage).

### Key Achievements

1. **TDD Implementation**: Successfully implemented Test-Driven Development approach
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with testable components
3. **Mock Implementations**: Created comprehensive mocks for external dependencies
4. **Event-Driven Testing**: Properly tested asynchronous event emissions
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios covered

### Test Infrastructure

- **Test Framework**: Mocha with BDD style
- **Assertion Library**: Chai
- **Mocking**: Sinon.js
- **Coverage**: NYC (Istanbul)
- **TypeScript Support**: ts-node

### Next Steps for Full Coverage

To achieve comprehensive test coverage, the following components need tests:
1. OrchestratorManager
2. ToolManager
3. MemoryManager
4. ConfigManager
5. ChatPanel (UI components)
6. Command handlers
7. Integration tests
8. End-to-end tests

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run all tests (unit, integration, e2e)
npm run test:all
```

## Conclusion

The SPARC TDD-based implementation has been successfully set up with a working test infrastructure. The ChatManager component demonstrates proper unit testing with high coverage, serving as a template for testing the remaining components.
