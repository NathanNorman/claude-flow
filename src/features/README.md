# Feature System Implementation

## Overview

The feature system provides a transparent, extensible architecture for managing features in claude-flow. It follows SOLID principles and implements a clean architecture with proper separation of concerns.

## Core Components

### 1. **Feature** (`core/feature.ts`)
- Base abstract class for all features
- Implements lifecycle methods (initialize, start, stop, destroy)
- Manages feature state transitions
- Provides hooks for custom behavior

### 2. **FeatureManager** (`core/feature-manager.ts`)
- Manages the lifecycle of multiple features
- Handles feature registration/unregistration
- Controls feature enablement/disablement
- Integrates with transparency layer for logging

### 3. **FeatureRegistry** (`core/feature-registry.ts`)
- Discovers features from the filesystem
- Loads features dynamically
- Validates feature structure
- Scans for feature metadata

### 4. **TransparencyLayer** (`core/transparency-layer.ts`)
- Logs all feature-related events
- Provides event subscription mechanism
- Maintains event history
- Enables debugging and monitoring

### 5. **ConfigurationManager** (`core/configuration-manager.ts`)
- Manages feature configurations
- Persists configurations to disk
- Validates configuration schemas
- Supports partial updates

## Type System

All types are defined in `types/feature-types.ts`:

- **FeatureState**: Enum defining feature lifecycle states
- **FeaturePriority**: Enum for feature priority levels
- **IFeature**: Core feature interface
- **IFeatureManager**: Feature manager interface
- **IFeatureRegistry**: Feature registry interface
- **ITransparencyLayer**: Transparency layer interface
- **IConfigurationManager**: Configuration manager interface

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Feature, FeatureManager } from './features';

// Define a custom feature
class MyFeature extends Feature {
  constructor() {
    super({
      id: 'my-feature',
      name: 'My Feature',
      version: '1.0.0'
    });
  }

  async onInit() {
    console.log('Initializing my feature');
  }

  async onStart() {
    console.log('Starting my feature');
  }
}

// Use the feature
const manager = new FeatureManager();
const feature = new MyFeature();

await manager.register(feature);
await manager.enable('my-feature');
```

## Testing

Tests are provided in the `tests/` directory:
- `feature.test.ts` - Tests for the base Feature class
- `feature-manager.test.ts` - Tests for FeatureManager
- `feature-registry.test.ts` - Tests for FeatureRegistry
- `transparency-layer.test.ts` - Tests for TransparencyLayer
- `configuration-manager.test.ts` - Tests for ConfigurationManager
- `manual-test.ts` - Manual integration test runner

Run manual tests with:
```bash
npx tsx src/features/tests/manual-test.ts
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Open/Closed**: System is open for extension (new features) but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution**: All features can be used interchangeably through the IFeature interface
4. **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are focused and minimal
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Components depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with existing claude-flow CLI commands
2. Add more sophisticated feature discovery mechanisms
3. Implement feature dependency resolution
4. Add metrics collection and reporting
5. Create feature templates and generators
