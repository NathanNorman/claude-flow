   - Added icons and labels for different message types

2. **Dashboard Reorganization**

3. **Command Templates Integration**
   - Added dropdown to load command templates from `.claude/commands/`
   - Implemented automatic insertion of template content with user prompts
   - Added collapsible sections for Selected Template and Command Preview
   - Auto-collapse template sections when starting execution

4. **JSON Input Format Support**
   - Implemented `--input-format stream-json` for better template handling
   - Updated server to handle structured JSON input
   - Fixed shell escaping issues with complex prompts

5. **Smart Auto-Scroll**
   - Implemented intelligent auto-scroll that only stops when user actively scrolls up

6. **Raw JSON Viewing**
   - Added JSON toggle button with clear visual feedback (yellow "JSON ON" state)
   - Shows raw JSON for all event types when enabled
   - Individual copy buttons for each event's JSON
   - "Copy All" button to copy entire stream as JSON

7. **Fixed Swarm and Agent Updates**
