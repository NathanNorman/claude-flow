# ADR-001: Use TypeScript for Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a programming language for our Hello World application that provides:
- Type safety
- Better developer experience
- Maintainability at scale
- Strong ecosystem support

## Decision
We will use TypeScript 5.x as our primary development language.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Type Safety**: Catches errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Excellent IntelliSense and refactoring tools
- **Self-Documenting**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can mix JS and TS during migration
- **Strong Ecosystem**: Most npm packages have TypeScript definitions
- **Future-Proof**: Industry standard for modern Node.js applications

### Negative
- **Build Step Required**: Must compile TS to JS
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need TypeScript knowledge
- **Configuration Overhead**: tsconfig.json and type definitions
- **Slightly Slower Development**: Initial type annotations take time

### Mitigation
- Use strict TypeScript configuration from the start
- Provide TypeScript training resources
- Set up proper build tooling with hot reload
- Use type inference where possible to reduce boilerplate
