# ADR-002: Adopt Clean Architecture Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need an architectural pattern that:
- Separates concerns effectively
- Makes the application testable
- Allows for framework independence
- Supports long-term maintainability
- Scales with application complexity

## Decision
We will implement Clean Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture) with clear layer separation:
1. Domain Layer (innermost)
2. Application Layer
3. Infrastructure Layer
4. Presentation Layer (outermost)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap frameworks or databases
- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit dependencies between layers
- **Business Logic Protection**: Core logic is framework-agnostic
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different layers
- **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific layers

### Negative
- **Initial Complexity**: More files and abstractions upfront
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand the pattern
- **Potential Over-Engineering**: Simple features might feel complex
- **More Code**: Interfaces and mappings between layers

### Implementation Guidelines
```
Dependencies flow inward:
Presentation → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure
                                    ↓
                              (implements)
```

### Mitigation
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Provide clear examples and documentation
- Regular architecture review sessions
- Use code generation for boilerplate where appropriate
