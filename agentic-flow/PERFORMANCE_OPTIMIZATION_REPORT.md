```typescript
import { OptimizedNeuralNetwork } from './neural/optimization/OptimizedNeuralNetwork';
import { MemoryOptimizer } from './neural/optimization/MemoryOptimizer';
import { AgentCoordinationOptimizer } from './neural/optimization/AgentCoordinationOptimizer';

// Create optimized neural network
const network = new OptimizedNeuralNetwork({
  inputShape: [784],
  layers: [
    { type: 'dense', units: 128, activation: 'relu', useBatchNorm: true },
    { type: 'dense', units: 64, activation: 'relu', useBatchNorm: true },
    { type: 'dense', units: 10, activation: 'softmax' }
  ]
});

// Train with all optimizations
await network.buildModel();
const result = await network.trainOptimized(xTrain, yTrain, xVal, yVal);

// Quantize for faster inference
await network.quantizeModel(8);

// Optimized inference
const prediction = await network.predictOptimized(input);
```
