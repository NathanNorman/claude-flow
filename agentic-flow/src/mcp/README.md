});

// Spawn executor agents
const executor1 = await agent_spawn({

  capabilities: ["code-execution", "testing"]
});

const executor2 = await agent_spawn({
  name: "Data Processor",
  type: "executor", 
  capabilities: ["data-processing", "analysis"]
});

// Coordinate agents for a task
await agent_coordinate({
  agents: [coordinator.id, executor1.id, executor2.id],
  task: "Build and test a data processing pipeline",
  strategy: "hierarchical"
});
```

### Creating Workflows

```javascript
// Create a CI/CD workflow
const workflow = await workflow_create({
  name: "CI/CD Pipeline",
  description: "Continuous integration and deployment",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "Code Checkout",
      type: "agent_action",
      config: { capability: "version-control", action: "checkout" }
    },
    {
      name: "Build",
      type: "agent_action", 
      config: { capability: "build-system", action: "build" },
      dependencies: ["code-checkout"]
    },
    {
      name: "Test",
      type: "parallel",
      config: {
        steps: [
          {
            name: "Unit Tests",
            type: "agent_action",

const goal = await goal_parse({
  description: "Build a scalable web application with user authentication, real-time messaging, and analytics dashboard within 3 months",
  context: {
    priority: "high",
    constraints: ["budget: $50k", "team: 5 developers"]
  }
});

// Decompose into subgoals
const subgoals = await goal_decompose({
  goalId: goal.id,
  strategy: "functional",
  maxDepth: 3
});

// Track progress
await goal_update({
  goalId: goal.id,
  progress: 25,
  metrics: [
    { name: "Completion", value: 25 },
    { name: "Quality", value: 90 }
  ]
});
```

// Train a classification model
const model = await learning_train({
  type: "classification",
  data: {
    features: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],
    labels: ["class_a", "class_b", "class_a"]
  },
  parameters: {
    epochs: 100,
    batchSize: 32,
    learningRate: 0.001
  }

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **AgentManager**: Handles agent lifecycle, communication, and coordination
- **WorkflowEngine**: Manages workflow creation, execution, and monitoring  
- **GoalManager**: Processes goal parsing, decomposition, and tracking
- **LearningEngine**: Provides ML training, prediction, and model management

### Tool Handlers

- **AgentTools**: Implements agent-related MCP tools
- **WorkflowTools**: Implements workflow-related MCP tools
- **GoalTools**: Implements goal-related MCP tools
- **LearningTools**: Implements learning-related MCP tools

### Integration Points

The components are designed to work together:

- Goals can automatically create workflows for execution
- Workflow completion updates related goal progress
- Agent performance data feeds into learning models
- Learning models can optimize agent coordination strategies

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development, production)

### Logging

Logs are written to:
- Console (formatted with colors in development)
- `logs/combined.log` - All logs
- `logs/error.log` - Error logs only
- `logs/exceptions.log` - Uncaught exceptions

## Performance

The MCP server is optimized for concurrent operations:

- **Parallel Tool Execution**: Multiple tools can run simultaneously
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking execution for long-running tasks
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and resource management
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports hundreds of concurrent agents and workflows

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling includes:

- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating when components fail
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear descriptions for troubleshooting
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing for transient failures
- **Logging Integration**: All errors are logged with context

## Security

Security features include:

- **Input Validation**: All tool parameters are validated with Zod schemas
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Isolation**: Agents and workflows run in isolated contexts
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for security review
